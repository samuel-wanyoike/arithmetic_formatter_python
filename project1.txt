If you're specifically interested in developing the mobile app and the device to establish a connection between the phone and the electric meter, you can follow these steps:

1. Mobile App Development:
   - Choose a suitable platform (iOS, Android, or cross-platform) for app development.
   - Design and develop the user interface for the mobile app, including features like token purchase, balance check, and QR code generation.
   - Implement functionality to communicate securely with the electric meter device via a wireless communication technology (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi).
   - Integrate payment gateways to facilitate token purchase transactions.
   - Test, debug, and optimize the app for a smooth user experience.

2. Connection Device:
   - Research and select a wireless communication technology that is compatible with both the phone and the electric meter (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy, NFC).
   - Design and develop a small hardware device that acts as a bridge between the phone and the electric meter.
   - Implement the wireless communication protocol on the device to establish a connection with the mobile app and the electric meter.
   - Ensure the device has the capability to securely encode and transmit the token information to the electric meter.
   - Test and refine the device to ensure reliable and secure communication.

3. Integration:
   - Integrate the mobile app with the connection device SDK or library to enable communication between the app and the electric meter.
   - Implement the necessary code in the mobile app to send token information to the connection device, which will then transmit the data to the electric meter.
   - Test and troubleshoot the integration to ensure smooth data transfer between the app, connection device, and electric meter.
  
Remember to consider security aspects, such as encryption and authentication, throughout the development process to protect the communication between the app and the electric meter.

Bringing this project to life may require proficiency in mobile app development, firmware development for the connection device, and hardware implementation. It's recommended to consult with experts in those fields and thoroughly test the solution before deploying it in a live environment.
